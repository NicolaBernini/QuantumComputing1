# Overview 

List of Quantum Computation Models 
- Adiabatic Computing 
  - [Notes on Adiabatic Quantum Computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07617)
    - Pro: should be the most tolerant to noise and disurbs 

Key Strengths 
- Solving NP Hard Problems in Polynomial Time 
  - Also called `P=NP` 


# History 

Quantum Computation proposed by Feynman as a way to overcome the inefficiency of simulating Quanstum Phenomena on Classical Infrastructure
