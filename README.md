# Overview 

This is Repo contains paper reviews and coding experiments about Quantum Computing and Quantum Communications 

## Updates 

### 2019-05-24 

Added new [Paper Readthrough](https://github.com/NicolaBernini/QuantumComputing1/issues/1) about the very interesting [Quantum Shannon theory with superpositions of trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05292) regarding the introduction of a second level of quantization, focused on channels, in the Quantum Shannon Theory which introduced quantization for Information Carriers only 

## Quantum Computation Models 

Two models of Quantum Computation are presented 
- Boson Sampling (Weaker Quantum Computing)
- Universal Quantum Computing (Full Quantum Computing)
