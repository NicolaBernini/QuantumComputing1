### Extended Church-Turing Thesis 

The Extended Church-Turing Thesis (ECT) states that 

> Any physically realizable system can be efficiently simulated using a Turing Machine 

The Quantum Computing should be a valid counterexample as even if Quantum Computers are physically realizable (even if in very simple versions at the moment), they can't be effectively simulated on a Turing Machine (i.e. classical computer)

It means Quantum Computing is an inherently new way of Computing and it could possibly lead to "Quantum Supremacy" hence the possibility for a Quantum Computer to outperfom a Classical Computer / Turing Machine at any task
